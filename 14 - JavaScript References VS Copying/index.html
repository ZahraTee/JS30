    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[0] = 'Wesley';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team, players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or one more way
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Zahra',
      age: 22
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const dev = person;
    //dev.editor = "VS Code";

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person, {editor: "VS Code", startYear: 2013});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const devCopy = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
